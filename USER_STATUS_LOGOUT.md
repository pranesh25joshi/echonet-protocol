    - Shows success message (landing page)
    - Redirects to home (dashboard) or stays (landing page)
  â†’ NO: 
    - Dialog closes
    - User remains logged in
```

```
Landing Page loads â†’
  â†’ Checks AuthContext for user â†’
    â†’ User exists? 
      âœ… Show: User badge + Dashboard + Logout
    â†’ No user?
      âœ… Show: Login/Register button
```
