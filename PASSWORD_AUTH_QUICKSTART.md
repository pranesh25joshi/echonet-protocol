### File Changes
```
Modified Files:
├── server/package.json (bcrypt added)
├── server/src/models/User.js (password field, hashing, comparison)
├── server/src/controllers/authController.js (login function, password validation)
├── server/src/routes/authRoutes.js (login route)
├── client/src/context/AuthContext.jsx (loginUser function)
└── client/src/pages/Onboarding.jsx (password fields, login mode)

Documentation:
├── AUTHENTICATION.md (updated with password info)
└── TESTING_AUTH.md (comprehensive testing guide)
```

## 🔐 How It Works

### Registration Flow:
```
User enters password → Client validates → Server hashes → 
MongoDB stores hash → Session token issued → User logged in
```

### Login Flow:
```
User enters password → Server finds user → Compares hash → 
Valid? → New session token → User logged in
```

### Security:
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
- Never stored in plain text
- Never returned in API responses
- Session tokens (32-byte hex) for auth
- 90-day sessions for registered users

---

## 🎮 Three Access Modes

### 1. Guest Mode
- No credentials needed
- Browser fingerprint
- 30-day session
- Anonymous (Guest_xxxxx)

### 2. Register Account
- Username + Password
- Email (optional)
- 90-day session
- Persistent identity

### 3. Login

## 💾 Database Structure

### Guest User:
```json
{
  "username": "Guest_a1b2c3",
  "isGuest": true,
  "browserFingerprint": "sha256...",
  "sessionToken": "...",
  "sessionExpiry": "30 days"
}
```

### Registered User:
```json
{
  "username": "test_user",
  "password": "$2b$10$hashedPassword...",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "isGuest": false,
  "sessionToken": "...",
  "sessionExpiry": "90 days"
}
```

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### POST /api/auth/register
```json
Request:
{
  "username": "test_user",
  "password": "test123456",
  "email": "test@example.com"
}

Response:
{
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "username": "test_user",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "isGuest": false
  },
  "sessionToken": "..."
}
```

### POST /api/auth/login
```json
Request:
{
  "username": "test_user",
  "password": "test123456"
}

Response:
{
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "username": "test_user",
    "isGuest": false
  },
  "sessionToken": "..."
}
```

## 🎯 Answer to Your Question

### "How will the person verify after coming after some time that this username belongs to him?"

**Answer:** ✅ PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION

**Before:**
- Registered users had username but NO password
- Couldn't prove ownership when returning
- Fingerprinting only works on same browser

**After:**
- Registered users have username + password
- Can login from ANY device/browser
- Password proves "this username belongs to me"
- Session persists for 90 days
- Cross-device access secured

**Example:**
```
Day 1: Register on laptop
  → Username: agent_007
  → Password: mySecretPass

Day 30: Login from phone
  → Enter: agent_007 + mySecretPass
  → System verifies password hash
  → Access granted ✅
  → Proves you own this username!
```
